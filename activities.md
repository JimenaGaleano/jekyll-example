Merequetengue is the kind of place where you can’t just sit still—you’ll always find something calling you, whether it’s the mountains, the lake, or the energy of the streets. Here are some must-do activities while you’re here:

+ Hike up the mountains – Trails take you through lush paths until you reach viewpoints overlooking the lake. Sunrise hikes are unforgettable.

+ Kayak or paddleboard on the lake – The calm waters are perfect for exploring and taking in the scenery at your own pace.

+ Join a local workshop – Learn traditional crafts, cooking, or music directly from local artisans and families.

+ Nightlife for backpackers – The town comes alive at night with vibrant bars, live music, and spots to meet other travelers.

+ Yoga and meditation retreats – Many centers offer drop-in classes with lake views, perfect for recharging.

+ Street food adventures – Taste local snacks and drinks at night markets and small food stalls.

+ Cultural festivals – Depending on when you visit, you might stumble upon colorful parades, live performances, and spiritual ceremonies.


Merequetengue is all about balance: adventure during the day, connection and celebration at night.
